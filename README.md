This is a repository for the R/Python codes that would draw the plots introduced in the textbook of the course.
(Oehlert,G.W. (2003). "A First Course in Design and Analysis of Experiments")

The graphs are produced by MacAnova, a program for statistical analysis and matrix algebra written by Gary W. Oehlert and Chritopher Bingham (School of Statistics, University of Minnesota). I think it would be a good practice for me to write R/Python codes to produce some figures for two reasons: 1) practice my coding skill 2) be more engaged in learning

The data files that appear in the codes are all based on textbook examples.
